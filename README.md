## About
This repository contains my solutions to several USACO Bronze problems. Each solution is implemented as a standalone Python script, typically named after the problem.

## Files / Solutions
- [Mixed_Milk_Bronze.py](https://github.com/WathesMe/USACO/blob/main/Mixed_Milk_Bronze.py) — Solution for the "Mixed Milk" Bronze problem.
- [Shell_Game_Bronze.py](https://github.com/WathesMe/USACO/blob/main/Shell_Game_Bronze.py) — Simulation solution for the Shell Game problem.
- [Where_Am_I_Bronze.py](https://github.com/WathesMe/USACO/blob/main/Where_Am_I_Bronze.py) — Solution for the "Where Am I?" pattern problem.
- [Word_Processor_Bronze.py](https://github.com/WathesMe/USACO/blob/main/Word_Processor_Bronze.py) — Word wrapping / processor problem solution.
- [chatGPT_milk_1.py](https://github.com/WathesMe/USACO/blob/main/chatGPT_milk_1.py) — Experimental / alternate approach (ChatGPT-assisted) for the Mixed Milk problem.

If you'd like, I can add short README-style comments at the top of each file explaining input format and complexity.

## Usage
- Python 3.8+ recommended (should work with Python 3.x).
- No external libraries required — all solutions use the Python standard library.

## How to run a solution
1. Clone the repository (or run directly from the GitHub web UI).
2. From the repository root, run a script with Python. For problems that read from stdin or a file, you can provide input like:
   - Interactive / prompt style (if the script reads input via `input()`):
     - python3 Mixed_Milk_Bronze.py
   - Using redirected input from a file:
     - python3 Mixed_Milk_Bronze.py < input.txt
3. Check the top of each script for any problem-specific notes about expected input format or file IO. If you want, I can standardize all scripts to use USACO-style file IO (e.g., `input.txt` / `output.txt`) or add sample input files.
